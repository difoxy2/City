1. Input a 1)Number Label(better be a 2-digit number: 01, 02, 12...) and its length with a space betweeb:
            Label Length
            01	63
            02 45
            00 348
            02 24
            03	78
            04	13
            05	49
            06	37
            07	1
    If the Label is 0 or 00, cell color will be black.
    If the Label is a odd/even number, cell color will be dark blue/light blue.


2. Can add a new line anywhere in the list, and seat will relocate accordingly.


3. Click on a cell, and its Seat Information (i.e. Table#, row#, column#) will paste in the <p> at the bottom.


4. Click the [Remove Last Line] Button to delete the last line in <p>


5. Can change the Seat Information by changing the 3 Indexes in the .js (indexOfTableIDvsHKCECplan / indexOfrowvsHKCErow / indexOfcolvsHKCEcol).
          Guide to change the Indexes:
            //indexOfTableIDvsHKCECplan: Remember tables are arranged as snake biscuit(s shape): for 3x7= 21 tables, 8th table is under 7th table, not under 1st table (number of items in index = How many Tables are there)

            //indexOfrowvsHKCErow: simplest, just [A, ... ,Z,AA, ... ,ZZ, ... ,the last one] (number of items in index = number of global rows)

            //indexOfcolvsHKCEcol: 1.Remember tables are arranged as snake biscuit(s shape) 
                                   2. A = 1st item / B = 2nd item / C = 12th item / D = 13th item / E = 14th item / F = last item (i.e. 24th)

                                   ABo  ooo  ooo  ooC
                                   ABo  ooo  ooo  ooC
                                   ABo  ooo  ooo  ooC

                                   ooF  ooo  ooo  DEo
                                   ooF  ooo  ooo  DEo
                                   ooF  ooo  ooo  DEo   (number of items in index = number of global columns X how many tables in a column)
