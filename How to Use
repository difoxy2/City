    If the Label is 0 or 00, cell color will be black.
    For the odd/even-th items in the list, cell color will be dark blue/light blue.


2. Can add a new line anywhere in the list, and seat will relocate accordingly.


**Save the List / Paste it back later = save / load**


3. Click on a cell, and its Seat Information (i.e. Table#, row#, column#) will paste in the <p> at the bottom.


4. Click the [Remove Last Line] Button to delete the last line in <p>


5. Can change the Seat Information by changing the 3 Indexes in the .js (indexOfTableIDvsHKCECplan / indexOfrowvsHKCErow / indexOfcolvsHKCEcol).
          Guide to change of indexs:
             //indexOfTableIDvsHKCECplan: Remember tables are arranged as snake biscuit(s shape): for 3x7= 21 tables, 8th table is under 7th table, not under 1st table (number of items in index = How many Tables are there)

             //indexOfrowvsHKCErow: simple, just [A, ... ,Z,AA, ... ,ZZ, ... ,the last one] (number of items in index = how many global rows in total)

             //indexOfcolvsHKCEcol: simple, just [1 - the last one] (number of items in index = how many global columns in total)
